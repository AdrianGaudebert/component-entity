# Entity System for JavaScript

This is a JavaScript implementation of the Entity System model as described by Adam Martin in his blog post series [Entity Systems are the future of MMOs](http://t-machine.org/index.php/2009/10/26/entity-systems-are-the-future-of-mmos-part-5/).

You can find the [API documentation](api/) here. A more comprehensive documentation is coming, along with a tutorial. [Soon](http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/facebook/000/117/021/enhanced-buzz-28895-1301694293-0.jpg).
